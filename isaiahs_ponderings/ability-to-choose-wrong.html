        <h1 class="artic-header">The ability to choose wrong is more important than your comfort and even your life</h1>
        <img class="float-img-r" src="images/the-ponderer.jpg" alt="the ponderer">
        <p class="body-text">Your ability to choose wrong is intrinsic to your freedom and happiness. Without it you also couldn't choose right and doing right with no choice is courses and being coursed into doing good is worthless.</p>
        <p class="body-text">We can't ever take away people's option to choose wrong. The story of the garden of Eden teaches us this lesson. Why was the tree of the fruit of good and evil even there? Because without the option to fail and choose wrong the act of choosing right is rendered null and void. What we also learn from this story is that if someone chooses wrong they will gain knowledge from it and we must guard our personal trees of life against them because once we give them the fruit of eternity they become unchangeable to our eyes. We always want to give them a chance to change and we never want to immortalize their image unless they are perfect (That's why Christ is the one to raise from the dead because He was the only one to be perfect and not afraid of locking in His answer so to speak). </p>
        <p class="body-text">If we only have one option does it really matter what we choose or how good or bad that option was? No, at least as far as its reflection on our character. We can't take away the option to choose wrong because then there's no option to choose and therefore no option to choose right.        </p>
       
        <p class="body-text">In a political sense we also can't limit people's option to choose wrong, but for the same reasons as well as the fact that we don't know the absolute truths of what is right and wrong. If we thought ourselves educated enough to limit religious freedoms then perhaps Jim Jones wouldn't have led a mass suicide, but perhaps the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints wouldn't have been able to start either. If you take away someone's ability to choose their action then you'll never know if the other action was a better one</p>
        <img class="float-img-l" src="images/scribbles.jpeg" alt="thoughts">
        <p class="body-text">Obviously, we can make some judgment calls, like things that kill people are bad and not to be done, or you can't do anything that infringes on the rights of another person. But when you start to say you can't live your life in this way or you can't think like this then you limit society's possibilities and give more power to the government to say what can and can't be done. </p>
        <p class="body-text">If we gave the government power to quash all nazi speech then all that needs to be done to quiet the speech of someone you don't like is label them a nazi. We must run the risk and run the gambit of allowing terrible speech, thoughts, and ways of living in our society (so long as they don't hurt someone else) so that we don't let the camel's nose into the tent of our freedoms. That is why you can't stop someone from living in a way you see as wrong, that might be the wrong way, they have to have the option to choose wrong so that if they do choose right it will mean something, and if we allow the government to punish thought we can't control what thought it punishes.</p>
