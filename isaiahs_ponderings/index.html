                    I got curious as a child about what a higher dimension would look like, so I thought. I lay on my bed and thought and watched some videos and learned a basic rule. All dimensions are the previous dimension just copied infinitely on a 90-degree right angle.
                    A bunch of lines lined up together are a plane, a bunch of planes stacked on top of each other is space (not a cube because that’s not infinite). So logically the 0th dimension is a point. A point has no breadth width or height, and an infinite amount of points lined up together are a line. (boom) Then I thought that space can’t be multiplied at any other 90-degree angle because it’s taking up all the room, so what if we took a picture of it and lined those pictures up end to end and made a line with them making an infinite line, a timeline! Thus this system of dimensions would be a base 3 counting system. 0th, 1st, 2nd,  and then 3rd repeated the whole thing over again. You could then go on to a timeline a time plane and a time-space, but after several years I realized my error. These are spaces, not things. The plane exists regardless of whether something is on it or not, and this figurative exists regardless of whether something is in it or not....

                    This thought first came when gay rights was a big movement (now it’s settled more happily into where it wants to be and no longer needs to move very much). All these shows and charectors were comeing out as gay. Every new show had to have a gay character and shows were being praised as “the first kids show to show a gay kiss” yada yada yada. I didn’t like it. In part because I was new to people being openly gay and it was hard to wrap my head around, but also because it felt so fake. 
                    After a long time and the world progressing I think I have it more figured out.
                    Nobody likes fakeness, and we can feel when an element of a story was shoved into the story in a false way. For example legend of Korra. It felt so wrong all of it the whole serries felt half thought out and then to top it off they maid her bi in the last 2 minuets of the eniter show. I don’t care that's shes bi what I care about is that she’s bi just in time for the creatores to show their support to the movements of that time. Why is that bad? They sacrificed their story for it. Stories should be told for the sake of stories and not for propaganda. If a message is to be conved it should be conved as a natuaral by product of the story and not as an ententional message (their could be some exceptions to that rule. I don’t know I haven’t thought that far ahead)...
