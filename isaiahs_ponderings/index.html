        <p>Hi, my name is Isaiah Ponder Carrin (Get the title of the page now?) This is basically a bolg, but maybe I'll add more kind of things. For now it's just an idea I had and a rant I went on. Please click around and enjoy.</p>

                I got curious as a child about what a higher dimension would look like, so I thought. I lay on my bed and thought and watched some videos and learned a basic rule. All dimensions are the previous dimension just copied infinitely on a 90-degree right angle.
                A bunch of lines lined up together are a plane, a bunch of planes stacked on top of each other is space (not a cube because that’s not infinite). So logically the 0th dimension is a point. A point has no breadth width or height, and an infinite amount of points lined up together are a line. (boom) Then I thought that space can’t be multiplied at any other 90-degree angle because it’s taking up all the room, so what if we took a picture of it and lined those pictures up end to end and made a line with them making an infinite line, a timeline! Thus this system of dimensions would be a base 3 counting system. 0th, 1st, 2nd,  and then 3rd repeated the whole thing over again. You could then go on to a timeline a time plane and a time-space, but after several years I realized my error. These are spaces, not things. The plane exists regardless of whether something is on it or not, and this figurative exists regardless of whether something is in it or not. 
                During my earlier ponderings, I thought that time could be simulated as the dimensions you are seeing falling through a higher dimension. If a flat lander’s world fell through a 3D space they could angle the wind and push themselves with it. That would push them back, ever so slightly, in time, but isn’t that what happens when you get close to relativistic speeds? You slow down relative to everyone else, so I thought it jived. So a creature that lived in a dimension was actually able to interact with all previous dimensions, fell through the next one up, and saw his world in the next one down. We as 3d dimensional creatures fall through time and can only slow our selfs a little to change that. We see a 2d image from which we extrapolate our 3d world. A flat lander would fall through space and only see a line as its worldview. A 2-dimensional creature falls along a plane and can only see a dot forwards and a dot backward. A 0th-dimensional creature would see either fractional dimensions or negative ones. I’m not sure, but I think it would be fractional as that would look nicer using base 3 notation and using the power to represent that. 
                As I said before thought there was a problem. Time needs a thing or else it doesn’t exist. Time is the movement of molecules from one position to another and if there’s nothing there then it doesn’t exist. So (and I forgot my logical connections to these arguments so here go some claims with no base) time exists outside the dimensions. All dimensions feel its effects. Time is like falling through the next higher dimension but it’s not. It's just time. The next higher dimension isn’t a line of our space captured over and over again one moment to the next, it’s different spaces all the same or all different. It doesn’t matter what’s inside them it’s that they’re there. (though I would venture they’re other dimensions at different times in their history (essentially time travel, but if you shot your grandfather you wouldn’t die, your other self in that dimension would just never be born) and on the higher space plane (dimension 5) you would see alternat realities (would that push your dead grandfather reality off the line because it’s different not just a different time?) in space space I have no Idea

                This thought first came when gay rights was a big movement (now it’s settled more happily into where it wants to be and no longer needs to move very much). All these shows and charectors were comeing out as gay. Every new show had to have a gay character and shows were being praised as “the first kids show to show a gay kiss” yada yada yada. I didn’t like it. In part because I was new to people being openly gay and it was hard to wrap my head around, but also because it felt so fake. 
After a long time and the world progressing I think I have it more figured out.
Nobody likes fakeness, and we can feel when an element of a story was shoved into the story in a false way. For example legend of Korra. It felt so wrong all of it the whole serries felt half thought out and then to top it off they maid her bi in the last 2 minuets of the eniter show. I don’t care that's shes bi what I care about is that she’s bi just in time for the creatores to show their support to the movements of that time. Why is that bad? They sacrificed their story for it. Stories should be told for the sake of stories and not for propaganda. If a message is to be conved it should be conved as a natuaral by product of the story and not as an ententional message (their could be some exceptions to that rule. I don’t know I haven’t thought that far ahead). 
Captin Marvel was kinda crappy because the message was women empowerment and they tried to show it down your throat and in the worst way possible too. They tried to make captain marvel look strong by making her physically strong, have little to no character flaws, as masculine as possible, and by making all the men around her just a little incompetent. On the other great examples of stong female charactors can be found in miasaki movies where the women or girls are stong because of their grit and determination. One of my new all time favorite examples of a strong female character is luisa from encanto who is strong in spite of her physical strength. She could have hidden behind her strength like mr. Incredibles from incredibles 2 (still mad about how his character devoled from the first movie and he became more self centered than in the first one. [the whole first movie he is learning that helping people and being a super is great, but can’t come at the cost of his family. He learns to strike the balance between work and family, but then in the second he’s all gung ho to put his family on the line again in order to follow his hobbies. Also their reasoning behind elasta girl being the main test super was flawless, but we’ll get back to that]) but instead learnd to be vanurable and open up, she learned to let go and learn that everything isn’t all on her. She was storng but it was her character that made her a stong female character. Because a strong character isn’t one that wins it’s one that compels. 
To get back to the main point we’ll talk about mrs incredible in the second movie. The creators wanted to have a pro-women story with a stong femal lead. How did they do that? They created a story where a female would naturaly be in the spot light and put a compelling feamle in that spot light. The fact that she caused the least property damage, absolutly reasonable, oceans 8 being all grils because the lead con-artist thought girls flew under the radar better? Absolulty seems fine. The biggest baddest warrior being a girl? Dumb. Why? Because girls (to paraphrase enders game) have millions of years of eveolution working against them. The biggest warrior simply wouldn’t be a girl im sorry. That's what make stories reak of fakness is when the writers twist the world too much to put a message in. It's lazy writing and it’s terrible.

Now to get back to the gay thind. I don’t mind at all, but the writing has to be good and the world can’t bend too much to make it happen. I’ve started watching broklyn 99. I'm a few episodes in, but I’ve wathed a lot of clipps of it. Captin holt is a good character. In episode one when he said he was gay it din’t feel off. He’s blank enough that you couldn’t really put any sexuality to him. His character was written as that from the beginning. Whereas the female cop (forgot her name but the serious one) I know from clips on the internet comes out as bi. This feels less authentic to me and more like an after thought added in (I also know less bi people than I do homosexual people, so maybe that’s on me and it’s harder to tell a bi persons orentation just from inteacting with them). Still though it didn’t seem to fit. I feel when a character has a trait from the beginning even if it was planned to be revealed after the 3rd season and not be talked about before it would create natural clues or tips throughout the show (like when everyone says they knew you two would get together even though you didn’t even know. You didn’t know but you dropped clues here and left voids there. It’s a whole thing. Our brain are really good at picking up clues and diceting human behavior and haivng possabilities in the background. So when a new trait is added to a character 3 seassons in it feels unathentic.) 
So I find that I don’t mind shows being abot non-bianary charectors or anything like that I care about the writers adding in people, charator traits, or elements when they weren’t in the story line. Legand of Korra aparently was only green lighted for one season. After the first seasson was a smash hit they went on to do 3 more. The problem was she wasn’t written to have 4 seasons of growing she was written to have one, so after the first season the undid all her growth and strung it out over 3 more seasons. That feels wrong. If you watch just the first season alone it feels like a alright show, but combined with the other 3 it feels un thoguht out. All of this culminatites with them swapping charactors sexuality at the last instant, and then they didn’t even own up to it. “if we get the two together in the last 2 minuets then we don’t have to worry about people not coming for the next episode. There isn’t one!” (and for real asami deserved someone better than Korra. She litteraly made out with all of her friends)
