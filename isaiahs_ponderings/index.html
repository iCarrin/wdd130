        <p class="intro">This is basically a blog, but maybe I'll add more kinds of things. For now, it's just an idea I had and a rant I went on. Please click around and enjoy.</p>

                    I got curious as a child about what a higher dimension would look like, so I thought. I lay on my bed and thought and watched some videos and learned a basic rule. All dimensions are the previous dimension just copied infinitely on a 90-degree right angle. A bunch of lines lined up together are a plane, a bunch of planes stacked on top of each other is space (not a cube because that’s not infinite). So logically the 0th dimension is a point. A point has no breadth width or height, and an infinite amount of points lined up together are a line. (boom) But how do you multiply space on a 90-degree angle when it already is taking up all available room?

                    After a long time and the world progressing I think I have it more figured out. Nobody likes fakeness, and we can feel it when an element of a story was falsely shoved into the story. For example legend of Korra. It felt so wrong all of it the whole series felt half thought out and then to top it off they maid her bi in the last 2 minutes of the entire show. I don’t care that's shes bi what I care about is that she’s bi just in time for the creators to show their support for the movements of that time. Why is that bad? They sacrificed their story for it. Stories should be told for the sake of stories and not for propaganda. If a message is to be convened it should be convened as a natural byproduct of the story and not as an intentional message (there could be some exceptions to that rule. I don’t know I haven’t thought that far ahead)...

                    Light photons are actually an example of a 4th-dimensional object. people studying quantum physics found that when they shot just one photon of light through a tiny tiny slit just big enough for the light to get through that a wave pattern started to emerge as the places the light hit each time began to fall into a pattern.
