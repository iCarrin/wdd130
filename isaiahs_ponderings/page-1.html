        <p class="body-text">This is where we can talk about higher dimensions</p>
        <p class="body-text">I got curriouse as a child about what a higher dimestion would look like, so I thought. I laid on my bed and thought and watched some videos and learned a basic rule. </p>
        <p class="body-text">All dimensions are the privious dimension just coppied infinetly on a 90 degree right angle. A bunch of lines lined up together are a plan, a bunch of planes stacked on top of eachother are space (not a cube because that’s not infinte). So logically the 0th dimension is a point. A point has no breth width or height, and an infite amount of points lined up together are a line. (boom) </p>
        <p class="body-text">Space can’t be multiplied at any other 90 degree angle because it’s taking up all the room, so what it we took a picture of it and lined those pictures up end to end and made a line with them making a infinte line, a time line! Thuse this system of dimensions would be a base 3 counting sytem. 0th, 1st, 2nd,  and then 3rd repeates the whole thing over again. You could then go on to a time line a time plane and a time space, but after a number of years I realized my error. These are spaces not things. The plane exitsts regardless of weather something is on it or not, and this figurative 4th dimension exisits regardless of weather something is in it or not. </p>
        <p class="body-text">Durring my earlier ponderings I thought that time could be simulated as the dimensions you are seing falling through a higher dimension. If a flat lander’s world fell through a 3D space they could angle the wind and push themselves with it. That would push them backwards to a ever so slightly earlier time, but isn’t that was happenes when you get close to relitiveistic speeds? You slow down relitive to everyone else, so I thought it jived. So a creature that lived in a dimensions was actually able to interact with all privious dimensions, fell though a next one up and saw his world in the next one down. We as 3d dimetional creature fall throguh time and can only slow our selfs a little to change that. We see a 2d image from which we extrapulate our 3d world. A flat lander would fall through space and only see a line as it’s world view. A 2 dimensional creature falls along a plane and can only see a dot forwars and a dot backwards. A 0th dimensional creature would see either fractional dimeintions or negitive ones. (I’m not sure, but I think it would be fractional as that would look nicer using base 3 notation and using to the power to represent that.)</p>
        <p class="body-text">As I said before there’s a problem. Time needs a thing or else it doesn’t exist. Time is the movement of molecuels from one position to another and if there’s nothing there than it doesn’t exist. So (and I forgot my logical connections to these arguments so here goes some unbased claims) time exists outside the dimensions. All dimensions feel it’s affects. Time is like falling through the next higher dimension but it’s not. It's just time. The next higher dimension isn’t a line of our space captured over and over again one moment to the next, it’s different spaces all the same or all different. It doesn’t matter what’s inside them it’s that they’re there. (though I would venture they’re other dimensions at different times in their history (essetialy time travel, but if you shot your grand father you wouln’t die you other self in that dimension would just never be born) and on the higher space plane (dimension 5) you would see alternat realities (would that push your dead grand father reality off the line because it’s different not just a different time?) in space space I have no Idea</p>
        <p class="body-text">So a space line is the 4th dimension</p>
