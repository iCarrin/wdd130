        <h1 class="artic-header">Higher dimensions!!!</h1>
        <img class="float-img-l" src="images/parallel-univeres.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="body-text">This is where we can talk about higher dimensions</p>
        <p class="body-text">I got curious as a child about what a higher dimension would look like, so I thought. I lay on my bed and thought and watched some videos and learned a basic rule.</p>
        <p class="body-text">All dimensions are the previous dimension just copied infinitely on a 90-degree right angle. A bunch of lines lined up together is a plan, a bunch of planes stacked on top of each other is space (not a cube because that’s not infinite). So logically the 0th dimension is a point. A point has no breadth width or height, and an infinite amount of points lined up together are a line. (boom)</p>
        <p class="body-text">Space can’t be multiplied at any other 90-degree angle because it’s taking up all the room, so what if we took a picture of it and lined those pictures up end to end and made a line with them making an infinite line, a timeline! Thus this system of dimensions would be a base 3 counting system. 0th, 1st, 2nd, and then 3rd repeated the whole thing over again. You could then go on to a timeline a time plane and a time-space, but after some years I realized my error. These are spaces, not things. The plane exists regardless of whether something is on it or not, and this figurative 4th dimension exists regardless of whether something is in it or not.</p>
        <p class="body-text">During my earlier ponderings, I thought that time could be simulated as the dimensions you are seeing falling through a higher dimension. If a flat lander’s world fell through a 3D space they could angle the wind and push themselves with it. That would push them back to an ever so slightly earlier time, but isn’t that happening when you get close to relativistic speeds? You slow down relative to everyone else, so I thought it jived. So a creature that lived in dimensions was actually able to interact with all previous dimensions, fell through the next one up, and saw his world in the next one down. We as 3d dimensional creatures fall through time and can only slow our selfs a little to change that. We see a 2d image from which we extrapolate our 3d world. A flat lander would fall through space and only see a line as its worldview. A 2-dimensional creature falls along a plane and can only see a dot forward and a dot backward. A 0th-dimensional creature would see either fractional dimensions or negative ones. (I’m not sure, but I think it would be fractional as that would look nicer using base 3 notation and using the power to represent that.)</p>
        <p class="body-text">As I said before there’s a problem. Time needs a thing or else it doesn’t exist. Time is the movement of molecules from one position to another and if there’s nothing there then it doesn’t exist. So (and I forgot my logical connections to these arguments so here goes some unbiased claims) time exists outside the dimensions. All dimensions feel its effects. Time is like falling through the next higher dimension but it’s not. It's just time. The next higher dimension isn’t a line of our space captured over and over again one moment to the next, it’s different spaces all the same or all different. It doesn’t matter what’s inside them it’s that they’re there. (though I would venture they’re other dimensions at different times in their history (essentially time travel, but if you shot your grandfather you wouldn’t die your other self in that dimension would just never be born) and on the higher space plane (dimension 5) you would see alternat realities (would that push your dead grandfather reality off the line because it’s different not just a different time?) in space space I have no Idea. So a space line is the 4th dimension</p>
        <img class="float-img-r" src="images/photons.jpeg" alt="light, a 4th dimentional object">
        <p class="body-text">Light photons are actually an example of a 4th dimentional object. people studying quantum physics found that when the shot just one photon of light through a tiny tiny slit just big enough for the light to get through that a wave pattern started to emeger as the places the light hit each time began to fall into a pattern.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Light photons are an example of a 4th-dimensional object. people studying quantum physics found that when they shot just one photon of light through a tiny tiny slit just big enough for the light to get through that a wave pattern started to emerge as the places the light hit each time began to fall into a pattern.</p>
        <p class="body-text">If you take a plate of cheese and put it on a cup (for elevation) in your microwave with no plate spinning you would see that the cheese melted in rows. This is because the microwave that heats the food breaches close to the top of the microwave box. The cheese absorbs the energy from the microwave and melts right where the wave hit it is rows because thats the only place the microwave reaches when your plate is raised on a cup. This image of rows formed by a wave's cross section is the same image researchers saw when shooting light through a narrow gap.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The only difference is that they shot one photon not an entire wave of them. The explanation that they came up with was the light must be interacting with other light. bouncing off of other particles to form this wave pattern when what logically should happen is all the light should have hit the same spot over and over again. The only issue with this theory was that the experiment room was pitch black</p>
        <p class="body-text">The scientist concluded that light from other dimensions was interacting with it. This means that light is a 4th-dimensional object able to interact with other dimensions we can ourselves see.</p>
