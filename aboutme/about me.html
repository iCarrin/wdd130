    <h2>Breif overview</h2>
    <p>Hi guys, my name is name Isaiah Carrin (it's pronouced like the prophet from the Bible want's to talk to the
        stores manager)
        I grew up in Atlanta Georgia, though I moved around some when I was a kid. I was raised home school without much
        of a social
        life outside of church yet I some how came out ok. I seved a mission in Anhiem California and afterward attended
        school up in
        Rexburge Idaho where I met my wife.

    <h2>Carrin trivia</h2>
    <p> To fill this out more Here are some fun facts. Out family has in the past adopted both flying squirrels and a
        baby dear. For a period of time I worked and slept at a trampoline park Friday through Sunday.
        I have had about 15 jobs since I started working at the age of 15 (23 now). I have been a carpenter, and yard
        hand a box truck driver, a trampoline court monitor, a door to door salesman, a phone sales man, a temple
        janitor, and a CAD jewler.
        I've only ever been fired from one job and that's when on vacation thinking my time was aproved and getting home
        after Christas to find out it wasn't.
